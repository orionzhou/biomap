QC plots:

- [read trimming and mapping statitics](/data/41_qc/01.readmapping.pdf)
- [PCA plot](/data/41_qc/12.pca.pdf)
- [t-SNE plot](/data/41_qc/12.tsne.pdf): note the much improved separation of tissues compared to PCA plot, and the separation of leaf samples into two distinct clusters

ASE analysis:
- [proportion conflicting reads for each sample](/data/41_qc/15.ase.pcft.pdf): genes in most samples have very low proportion of conflicting reads (typically less than 2%); abnormally high rates of conflicting reads might indicate sample genotype mis-labelling
- [proportion reads w. paternal allele in each sample](/data/41_qc/15.ase.pref.pdf): numbers indicate sample size (i.e., number of genes). most inbred samples have 0 paternal allele proportion while hybrid samples have 0.5 parternal allele proportion, exceptions may indicate sample genotype mis-labelling
